<div class="entry-content"><p>I graduated from the Technical University of Budapest to earn a M.Sc. in
Software Engineering. Albeit it is supposed to be an asset on my CV I&#8217;ll
argue below that the long years of university education was just not worth it.</p>

<p>When trying to summarize what advantage university education
brought me there is precious little I can think of. Five years is a lot of
time to spend without actually getting something out of it for one&#8217;s
professional career.</p>

<p>Obviously I&#8217;ve formed my opinion based on my university experience which
might not (and probably <em>is</em> not) be applicable to all higher education.
Philosophy, economics and law all require different formation
and practice might be harder (or outright dangerous) to attain in some
areas (think medicine).</p>

<p>Also, there is a great variance between countries although even the famously high-standard
US education system seems to yield not actual but rather
looks-good-on-my-CV benefits, say some <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/10/peter-thiel-were-in-a-bubble-and-its-not-the-internet-its-higher-education/" title="Peter Thiel: Education Bubble">smart</a> <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18750658" title="Stephen Wolfram">guys</a>.</p>

<h2>Learn to learn?</h2>

<p>Tech is changing extremely rapidly. Today&#8217;s hotness could be a thing of
the past in a few years. Consequently universities should not try to keep up with the
pace and teach students state-of-the-art stuff. Higher education needs to transcend
short-term utility and provide a base one can build on for the rest of
his career. So we were told or made to believe.</p>

<p>What is probably considered the essence of higher education is &#8220;learn to
learn&#8221;. It is the idea that universities need to teach future-engineers
how to quickly adapt to new fields and techniques (programming
languages, databases, architectures, etc.).</p>

<p>This is appealing but universities don&#8217;t do that. I had to sit through
long hours of material not even vaguely related to software engineering.
The practical stuff (e.g programming languages) was taught with stone age style methods
(programming on paper).  The other subjects, those that were supposed to provide us the broad
vision, I suppose, were way too much in volume and failed to achieve that goal.</p>

<h2>Make to learn</h2>

<p>In my current job I&#8217;m lucky to work with some guys who dropped out of
college and started to work. They might not
know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim's_algorithm" title="Prim's algorithm">Prim&#8217;s algorithm</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem" title="Intermediate value theorem">intermediate value theorem</a>,
but I think the result of the time they spent making things greatly surpass the time I
spent learning the above.</p>

<p>Programming (or, in its more CV-friendly, hire-me name: software
engineering) is a task that could be the modern equivalent of wood carving.
You can learn all that you want about the craft, the only thing that
really matters is doing it, a lot. Only, programming is way better.
There is virtually no waste (unless you publish what you make :) ) and
the tools are more accessible and cheaper.</p>

<p>Take it from someone who, unlike most kiddos at the university, started
programming late: it feels awkward and weird at first. And then the
second and third time, too. Slowly, though, you start to feel like it&#8217;s actually
fun and sometimes more than that. You&#8217;re building something which you&#8217;ll
look at ashamedly a few months later but at least your program does something extraordinary,
like sorting a list of numbers. That&#8217;s science!</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree" title="B-tree">Math data constructs</a>, probability theory and cryptography notwithstanding,
have you got this feeling of coolness (dare I say, awe) out of university lectures?</p>

<h2>Total waste, really?</h2>

<p>In fairness, and as a measure to counter my arrogance, I had to consider arguments
on the pro-education side, too. Here is what I came up with:</p>

<h3>Math</h3>

<p>When faced with a programming challenge I
can recall on some occasions an algorithm used to resolve a similar problem.
That&#8217;s not to say you can&#8217;t google up a solution if you have a vague
idea what to look for. Nevertheless if you can mentally page through the solutions
for a given problem from your university classes, their time and space
needs and their constraints then you surely save a lot of time.
I forgot all the relevant facts about any algorithm and have to look it
up every single time, but it could be me.</p>

<h3>Deciding on one&#8217;s vocation</h3>

<p>Most kids don&#8217;t know what to do with their life when they are 18. Real
life still seems distant and most want a few more years of canteen,
beers and idling. Whether it is beneficial for them or society
(taxpayers) as a whole to be allowed to do that is another matter.
Nevertheless, I&#8217;m convinced that a high number of students can have a
clearer picture about whether they want to do &#8220;computer science&#8221; for the
rest of their lives after a couple of years.</p>

<h3>Outstanding teachers</h3>

<p>Even though I reckon you can learn everything you need to know on your
own (from the Internet), having a good teacher can squeeze your
learning curve. Although I believe this is more attainable with a small
group (and even more in a one-to-one, mentoring relationship) it&#8217;s
definitely possible for an outstanding teacher to speed up absorbing
knowledge with a bigger group, too. Unfortunately, with one notable
exception, my teachers were not of this type, but
that&#8217;s a weak argument against college education in general.</p>

<p>Even if all these pro-education arguments are valid, however, a couple
of years is surely enough to derive all the advantages they bring.
Then, you still have 3 years to go and carve wood.</p>

<h2>On navigation</h2>

<p>Let me finally share a quote I&#8217;ve just found in Walden by H.D. Thoreau and that
summarizes my intent with this post in one swell sentence:</p>

<blockquote><p>To my astonishment I was informed on leaving college that I had studied<br/>navigation! &#8211; why, if I had taken one turn down the harbor I should<br/>have known more about it.</p><footer><strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong> <cite>Walden</cite></footer></blockquote>


<h2>Please defend the status quo (or indulge in bashing it)</h2>

<p>As I stated in the introduction, my opinion is just a drop in the ocean,
a tiny slice in a big cake, a lone voice in the NY Stock Exchange (you
get my point).</p>

<p>If you <a href="http://www.codigoergosum.com/2011/09/28/five-wasted-years-futility-of-university-education.html" title="Comments">share your opinion</a>, there will be two voices already and we&#8217;ll
have more information to decide about whether we should advise our children to go
to college, for example. Then three. We may even reach four voices.</p>

<p>Joking aside, if you went to college to learn computer science in Hungary
or in another country, I&#8217;m interested to <a href="http://www.codigoergosum.com/2011/09/28/five-wasted-years-futility-of-university-education.html" title="Comments">hear your opinion</a>. If you
studied something else, don&#8217;t be discouraged, please <a href="http://www.codigoergosum.com/2011/09/28/five-wasted-years-futility-of-university-education.html" title="Comments">share also</a>. My
points are mostly valid for computer science but I&#8217;m curious to hear
which other fields they hold true in (or in which fields they don&#8217;t).</p>
