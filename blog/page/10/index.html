  <div class="entry-content"><p>Though it is said that we live in a highly-globalized world, all countries still have their own proper currency (with one exception that I know of, the euro) so we still need to convert between them. If one is used to shop online (and one is) the need to get the price in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_forint" target="_blank">national currency</a> occurs quite often. Going to a currency converter page is not much of a hassle but it still takes too much time and it seemed an overshoot to use a browser for this task. Inspired by Rails&#8217;s date calculations extensions (where you could write 3.days.ago), I decided to create something similar and see how much flying to <a href="http://euruko2009.org/">Barcelona</a> or buying a <a href="http://pragprog.com/">PragProg</a> book costs from the command line.</p>

<pre lang="ruby">

require "net/http"
require "open-uri"
require "hpricot"

# makes 1284.eur.to.usd types of queries possible
class CurrencyConverter
 
  Currencies = { :huf => "HUF", :eur => "EUR", :usd => "USD", :gbp => "GBP", :chf => "CHF" }
 
  # these methods "close" the quote.
  # when they are called, it means all data is ready
  # the quote can be sent.
  class_eval do
    Currencies.each_key do |curr|
      define_method curr do
        @to = curr
        calculate
      end
    end
  end
 
  def initialize(amount, from=nil, to=nil)
    @amount = amount
    @from = from
    @to = to
  end
 
  def send_request_for_quote
   from_as_param = @from.to_s.upcase
   to_as_param = @to.to_s.upcase
   url = "http://xurrency.com/#{[@amount, @from, @to].join('/')}/feed"
   doc = Hpricot(open(url).read)
   (doc/'dc:value').inner_html
  end
 
  def calculate
    send_request_for_quote
  end

  def to
    self
  end
 
end

class Fixnum 
  def method_missing(name)
    CurrencyConverter.new(self, name)   
  end
end
</pre>


<p>Thanks to ruby&#8217;s open classes, the code is quite terse (you can also see and download the raw script from <a href="http://www.pastie.org/362737">here</a>). Now you can fire up irb and do all the conversions you want:</p>

<pre lang="shell">
$ irb -r currency_converter.rb 
irb(main):001:0> 23.eur.to.huf
=> "6473.3500"
irb(main):002:0> 1.usd.to.eur
=> "0.7642"
</pre>


<p>Or do it through the ruby interpreter:</p>

<pre lang="shell">
$ ruby -r rubygems -r currency_converter.rb -e "puts 1.eur.to.usd"
1.3085
</pre>


<p>I find it very pleasing to be able to write &#8220;10.eur.to.usd&#8221; since it is so close to our spoken, human language. One of ruby&#8217;s numerous charms.</p>

<p>My friend, <a href="http://www.rubyrailways.com/">Peter</a> sent a more general solution that uses html scraping with <a href="http://scrubyt.org/">Scrubyt</a> and the conversion capabilities of Google search:</p>

<pre lang="ruby">
require 'rubygems'
require 'cgi'
require 'scrubyt'

begin
google_converter = Scrubyt::Extractor.define do
  fetch "http://www.google.com/search?q=#{CGI::escape(ARGV[0])}+#{CGI::escape(ARGV[1])}+to+#{CGI::escape(ARGV[2])}"
  
  google_result "//td[@dir='ltr']" do
    final_result(/= (.+) /)
  end
end
  puts google_converter.to_hash[0][:final_result]
rescue
  puts "Sorry, even *google* can't translate that!"
end
</pre>


<p>Using this you can convert amounts between any two currencies (distances, weights, etc., everything that Google search can handle):</p>

<pre lang="shell">
$ ruby conv.rb 30 EUR HUF
</pre>


<p>It may be swimming against the current but I like solutions that do not need the browser for simple problems like this one. I scratched my itch and hopefully scratched yours, too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Though I thought I would only post about technical issues here, I now make an exception. After all, (soft) rules are for breaking occasionally, aren&#8217;t they?</p>

<p>So in case you don&#8217;t know, there is a nice <a title="Gmap Pedometer" href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/" target="_blank">service out there to record your bike trips</a> that I have recently discovered. It is a Google Maps application where you first search your point of departure then your point of arrival and Gmap Pedometer does the rest for you. Occasionally you have to lend it a helping hand, though, in case the automatic route generation does not work well. It usually does not if you take bicycle roads that does not run paralelly with the highway since the automatic route generation selects the &#8220;car route&#8221; by default (it seemed to me). You can set up your itinerary in no time and promptly see the distance you did and how much energy you burned during the process (and ultimately also the elevation of your trip).</p>

<p>I also grab the opportunity to tell you how bike tours are the perfect way of tourism for me. You can easily do 40-50kms per day in a moderate pace. In my opinion that&#8217;s a perfect middle ground between being too slow and passing by magnificent landscapes and towns in a car. What&#8217;s more, there is the thrill of riding your bike, feeling the air against your cheeks, the ability to stop anywhere and the ambiance of adventure that comes with the nomad lifestyle.</p>

<p>One thing I miss is a convenient method to store your trips. According to the site itself, Gmap Pedometer is &#8220;A hack that uses Google&#8217;s mapping application to help record distances traveled and calories burned during a running or walking workout.&#8221; so one should not expect a full-fletched, shiny application but a basic user registration/login method would be handy so I could quickly access my trips. To be able to review your trips, you must store the unique url that is generated for each one in a safe place.</p>

<p>To give you some example routes and also to store a pointer to some trips I would like to be able to access in the future I list the daily routes of two fairly recent bike routes:</p>

<p>The Netherlands (summer 2007)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2438133" target="_blank">Amsterdam - Den Haag</a>
<a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2438137" target="_blank">Amsterdam - Enkhuizen</a>
<a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2438142" target="_blank">Urk - Elburg</a>
<a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2438147" target="_blank">Elburg - Appeldoorn (Beekbergen)</a>
<a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2438149" target="_blank">Beekbergen - Arnhem (Oosterbeek)</a></p>

<p>Austria, going along the Danube (summer 2006)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2438164" target="_blank">Passau - Obernzell</a>
<a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2438172" target="_blank">Obernzell - Feldkirchen</a>
<a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2438183" target="_blank">Feldkirchen - Au an der Donau</a>
<a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2438189" target="_blank">Au an der Donau - Willersbach</a>
<a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2438194" target="_blank">Willersbach - Aggsbach</a>
<a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2438196" target="_blank">Aggsbach - Krems</a></p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Hop on your bike! :)</p>

<p>ps. Walking trips can also be recorded on the site and there is automatic route generation for walkers, too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So <a href="http://bucionrails.com/2008/12/06/exploring-ruby-metaprogramming-call-counter/" target="_blank">last time</a> I left you with the promise that I&#8217;d return with a solution so that the number of times a certain method was called is a class method which makes more sense than if it was an instance method. So here is the &#8220;improved version&#8221;:</p>

<p><strong>call_counter.rb:</strong></p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='ruby'>module CallCounter
        
    def count_calls_to(method_name)
      original_method = instance_method(method_name)
            
      unless class_variable_defined?(:@@call_counter):
        class_variable_set(:@@call_counter, {})
      end
    
      call_counter = class_variable_get(:@@call_counter)
    
      define_method(method_name) do |*args|
        call_counter[method_name] ||= 0
        call_counter[method_name] += 1
        bound_original_method = original_method.bind(self)
        bound_original_method.call(*args)
      end

      metaclass = class &lt;&lt; self; self; end
      metaclass.instance_eval do

        define_method(:calls_to) do |m|
          call_counter[m].nil? ? 0 : call_counter[m]
        end

        define_method(:reset_counters) do
          call_counter.each_key do |k|
            call_counter[k] = 0
          end
        end
    end
    
  end

end</code></pre>
</div>


<p>What has changed is the introduction of a class variable that counts the calls on all watched methods and that the number of calls on each method is queried by calls_to(&lt;method name&gt;) instead of calls_to_&lt;method_name&gt;. A bit less magic.</p>

<p><strong>call_foo.rb:</strong></p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='ruby'>require &quot;call_counter&quot;

class CallFoo
    
  extend CallCounter

  def foo; &quot;foo&quot;; end
  def bar; &quot;bar&quot;; end

  count_calls_to :foo
  count_calls_to :bar

end</code></pre>
</div>


<p><strong>(a snippet of) call_counter_spec.rb:</strong></p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='ruby'>require &quot;call_foo&quot;
require &quot;spec&quot;
    
describe CallFoo do
    
  before(:each) do
    @call_foo = CallFoo.new
    CallFoo.reset_counters
  end
        
  it &quot;should be able to count several methods&#39; calls&quot; do
    4.times { @call_foo.foo }
    CallFoo.calls_to(:foo).should == 4
    7.times { @call_foo.bar }
    CallFoo.calls_to(:bar).should == 7
  end
    
end</code></pre>
</div>


<p>I&#8217;m still not 100% content with this solution, the programming interface is nice now but it would be cool to get rid of the class variable somehow, possibly replacing it with closures. If you know how to achieve it, please leave a comment.</p>

<p>ps. You can also get <a href="http://pastie.org/338877">the whole code in nice colored format</a> or <a href="http://pastie.org/338877.txt">the raw text version</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I purchased a <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-dtrubyom/the-ruby-object-model-and-metaprogramming">screencast by Dave Thomas on Ruby metaprogramming</a>. (I do not receive any affiliation fees :)). The part I bought presents a problem and describes nine different ways of solving it in ascending order of beauty and code clarity.</p>

<p>I was stunned by its beauty so I came up with another -though similar- problem and put together a simple solution for it. I present it for the Rubyists to silently smile in the knowledge of its elegance and power and for non-Ruby programmers to be -hopefully :)- amazed by it.</p>

<p>The task is to count the calls to a certain method of all instances of a class.</p>

<p>call_counter.rb:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='ruby'>module CallCounter
  def count_calls_to(method_name)
    original_method = instance_method(method_name)
    
    call_counter = 0
    define_method(method_name) do |*args|
        call_counter += 1
        bound_original_method = original_method.bind(self)
        bound_original_method.call(*args)
    end

    define_method &quot;calls_to_#{method_name}&quot; do
        call_counter
    end     
  end
end</code></pre>
</div>


<p>call_foo.rb:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='ruby'>require &quot;call_counter&quot;

class CallFoo
    
    extend CallCounter

    def foo; end
    count_calls_to :foo

end</code></pre>
</div>


<p>After calling &#8220;count_calls_to :foo&#8221; in the CallFoo class definition, calls to the &#8220;foo&#8221; method of CallFoo instances will be counted. A &#8220;calls_to_foo&#8221; method is available to get this count.</p>

<p>I first created an UnboundMethod with &#8220;instance_method&#8221; and then used the bind method to attach it to an instance of ClassFoo. All this is to prevent aliasing method names, not because it is necessarily evil but because I agree with Dave Thomas about &#8220;bind&#8221; being a nicer solution. The define_method acts as a closure and saves its context so there is no need to use an instance variable for call_counter.</p>

<p>You can use the counter like this:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='ruby'>irb(main):003:0&gt; cf = CallFoo.new
=&gt; #&lt;CallFoo:0x608100&gt;
irb(main):004:0&gt; cf.calls_to_foo
=&gt; 0
irb(main):005:0&gt; 4.times { cf.foo }
=&gt; 4
irb(main):006:0&gt; cf.calls_to_foo
=&gt; 4</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Once again, what I love about Ruby is that in ~ 20 lines we have laid the base of a benchmarking tool (adding the possibility of measuring time spent in the method would not be hard). Also, the original class is not sullied by the call counting code intrinsic details. That functionality is stashed in a module, eager to be reused again.</p>

<p>You may note there is something not quite nice about this. The method calls are counted per class, which makes sense since we usually want to know how many times the method in question was called in all instances, not per instance. However, the calls_to_foo is called on the instance which is confusing. It should be called on the class object, like this:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='ruby'>4.times { cf.foo }
  CallFoo.calls_to_foo
  =&gt; 4</code></pre>
</div>


<p>I may get back to this later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Git is extremely powerful. I knew that much and that I would really like to thoroughly master it because it is so cool. However, it is quite sophisticated (not to mention that some commands, like checkout and revert designate totally different actions than in Subversion where I am coming from) and like with most things one learns by doing.</p>

<p>One key to doing is the ability to play around with a git repository. The possibility to have an account on <a href="http://github.com">github.com</a> and to contribute to a myriad of open source projects there removed that obstacle. The other ingredient to be a master chef is a good guide in the subject. One needs some initial self-confidence to know what he is doing lest he screws up his own work. (Note: that is very hard with git but I remember the panic when I did &#8220;git checkout &lt;earlier commit&gt;&#8221; and I did not find my earlier HEAD with &#8220;git log&#8221; )</p>

<p>We may be different but I have not read a really insightful guide albeit I have gone through a dozen of them. Some are too vague or concentrate on one specific task (e.g how to create a repo on github and push to it) and some present too many options and go into details that intimidate the novice. (like the official man pages). Ladies and gentlemen, I have found it. It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">Git User&#8217;s Manual</a> and it strikes the perfect balance between verbosity and shallowness. It gives examples which nicely clarify the concepts. It won&#8217;t make you an expert right away, of course, but it provides you with the insight and initial courage to embark on the journey.</p>

<p>I checked that the header file is there (on the path the install script was looking for it), and decided not to go the hard way. After some googling I found there is a <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rmagick/">rmagick-osx-installer</a> which downloads, compiles and installs ImageMagick and rmagick. Just what I needed.</p>

<p>However, the script failed to accomplish its mission, it hung when installing rmagick. Taking a peak in its log I saw several other errors so I had to look for another way. And that way was compiling the ImageMagick library myself. So I downloaded <a href="http://imagemagick.linux-mirror.org/download/www/install-source.html#unix">the source</a>, made the configuration-make-make install cycle and fortunately everything went smoothly. The good news is I could install rmagick without any problem after that:</p>

<pre lang="shell">
balint$ sudo gem install rmagick
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
Successfully installed rmagick-2.7.2

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just returned from Madrid where the Spanish Rails Conference, <a href="http://www.conferenciarails.org/">Conferencia Rails</a> was held. I liked it quite a lot, there were several interesting talks most of which made me want to learn all of that and very fast (one thing conferences do to me is to boost that healthy feeling of wanting to always learn and discover new things). So I would like to add my e-voice to the web noise: congratulations and thank you to the organizers and presenters!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Using alert() for debugging javascript is a pain. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843" target="_blank">Firebug</a> makes it a lot easier and enables several debug facilities (e.g inserting breakpoints, stepping into methods, adding variable watches) but a painless logging mechanism would still be very useful to supplement Firebug&#8217;s features.</p>

<p>Enter <a title="Blackbird" href="http://bucionrails.com/http://www.gscottolson.com/blackbirdjs/" target="_blank">Blackbird</a>, a simple javascript logging tool which has a very clean, nice API and a cool console. It&#8217;s really worth to check out, you can download the Blackbird files <a href="http://blackbirdjs.googlecode.com/files/blackbirdjs-1.0.zip" target="_self">here</a> and my demo <a href="http://bucionrails.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/blackbird_trial.html">here</a> to try out its features. (If you use my demo, you have to save the Blackbird files in a directory named blackbirdjs that is situated in the same directory as the demo page)</p>

<p>Blackbird&#8217;s motto says it all: say &#8220;hello&#8221; to Blackbird and &#8220;goodbye&#8221; to alert().<a href="http://bucionrails.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/blackbird_trial.html">

  <div class="entry-content"><p>John Resig has an extraordinary advanced javascript tutorial on his <a href="http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/" target="_blank">blog</a> that he presented on <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/webexny2008/public/content/home" target="_blank">a web conference</a>. It is definitely worth a walk-through since it expands one&#8217;s javascript horizon unless one has not written a javascript framework himself.</p>

<p>I played around with several of his slides learning a lot. My favorite was probably <a href="http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/#90">the last slide</a> which explains how method overloading works using the fact that <em>methodname</em>.length in javascript gives back the number of expected arguments of that function.</p>

<pre lang="javascript">
function addMethod(object, name, fn){ 
  // Save a reference to the old method 
  var old = object[ name ];
 
  // Overwrite the method with our new one 
  object[ name ] = function(){ 
    // Check the number of incoming arguments, 
    // compared to our overloaded function 
    if ( fn.length == arguments.length ) 
      // If there was a match, run the function 
      return fn.apply( this, arguments ); 
 
    // Otherwise, fallback to the old method 
    else if ( typeof old === "function" ) 
      return old.apply( this, arguments ); 
  }; 
} 
 
function Ninjas(){ 
  var ninjas = [ "Dean Edwards", "Sam Stephenson", "Alex Russell" ]; 
  addMethod(this, "find", function(){ 
    return ninjas; 
  }); 
  addMethod(this, "find", function(name){ 
    var ret = []; 
    for ( var i = 0; i < ninjas.length; i++ ) 
      if ( ninjas[i].indexOf(name) == 0 ) 
        ret.push( ninjas[i] ); 
    return ret; 
  }); 
  addMethod(this, "find", function(first, last){ 
    var ret = []; 
    for ( var i = 0; i < ninjas.length; i++ ) 
      if ( ninjas[i] == (first + " " + last) ) 
        ret.push( ninjas[i] ); 
    return ret; 
  }); 
} 
 
var ninjas = new Ninjas(); 
assert( ninjas.find().length == 3, "Finds all ninjas" ); 
assert( ninjas.find("Sam").length == 1, "Finds ninjas by first name" ); 
assert( ninjas.find("Dean", "Edwards").length == 1, "Finds ninjas by first and last name" ); 
assert( ninjas.find("Alex", "X", "Russell") == null, "Does nothing" );
</pre>


<p>It took me some time to figure out how exactly the method calls are routed but it was an interesting process nevertheless. I guess the one tricky part to interpret is the following bit:</p>

<pre lang="javascript">
if ( fn.length == arguments.length ) 
  // If there was a match, run the function 
  return fn.apply( this, arguments ); 
 
  // Otherwise, fallback to the old method 
  else if ( typeof old === "function" ) 
    return old.apply( this, arguments ); 
  }; 
</pre>


<p>This makes a method chain and allows for method overloading. With the three addMethod calls in the above example a chained method is built up.</p>

<p>After the call to addMethod with no arguments (the first one), the find method of the Ninjas &#8220;class&#8221; will return all ninjas if called with no arguments and do nothing if called with any number of arguments. After the call to addMethod with one single name argument the find method will return the ninjas whose first name matches the passed argument if there is only one argument, return all ninjas if it has been called with no arguments and do nothing otherwise.</p>

<p>I could go on but the pattern is probably clear now. At each call of the find method, the lastly added method is matched for the number of arguments (so in the above example, it will match if the caller passed two arguments) and the method called if the match is successful. Otherwise, it will try to match the number of arguments with the method that was added before the last one, and so on.</p>

<p>I am elaborating this in so much detail because</p>

<ol>
    <li>it was such a &#8220;Eureka!&#8221; moment for me when I got it. </li>
    <li>it is an incredibly ingenious way to flex the possibilites of javascript and introduce an OOP concept into an originally non-OOP language.</li>

</ol>


<p>I think John Resig made javascript lovable again which is why he deserves my total gratitude.</p>
