  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a quiet four months over here. My excuse is that I&#8217;ve been working. I joined a startup, <a href="http://secretsaucepartners.com">Secret Sauce Partners</a> in June and we have started to build our first product a couple of weeks later. Now I am proud (actually, quite proud) to announce that we have released a first version last week.</p>

<h2>The problem we are solving</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you have a Facebook account. You probably have around <a href="http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics">130 &#8220;friends&#8221;</a>. Chances are you want to share lots of things but on several occasions you don&#8217;t want to tell everybody. Sure, you can create friend lists and post to them based on what you want to say. Or, you can pick individual friends for your message (good luck with that if you would like to speak to more than 3 friends). It would definitely make sense (and would hugely improve the state of the world!) if you only showed your Farmville achievements to your friends who play Farmville and nobody else. Especially not your colleagues during work hours.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if you did not have to fiddle with setting the proper audience of your posts every single time you share something? If the people whom you post to would be determined from the content and the context of your message? Better still, if friends that join later could not see your posts prior to that?</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s go back to Farmville-land (I know, I know, but bear with me for a few more minutes). If you only want to show your Farmville posts to selected people the only way to achieve it is to set your default privacy to that list of selected friends prior to diving in to FarmVille. Then you set it back to your default posting setting. Not quite comfortable.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s where our application comes into the picture. To solve the above problem, you set up a rule that says:
&#8220;Hide posts from Farmville posted during Work Hours from my Co-Workers&#8221;. You lay back, go feed your piggies, and water your sunflowers safe in the knowledge that your colleagues will not know about it. Suppose you don&#8217;t want your mom to know where you spend your weekends. Here is your rule: &#8220;Hide All posts from Foursquare from Family&#8221;. Feeling the urge to swear like a sailor some times and don&#8217;t want your little cousins or nieces to know about it? &#8220;Always hide posts with Swear Words from Kids&#8221;. Don&#8217;t want to spam your Twitter followers on Facebook? &#8220;Always hide posts from Twitter from Twitter followers&#8221;. Then, there are the &#8220;Show&#8221; rules*. For example, an even more sensible rule for Farmville posts could be: &#8220;Always show posts from Farmville to Players&#8221;.
(* &#8220;Show rules&#8221; are the next feature we are going to work on.)</p>

<p>You see, the possibilities are endless, so why don&#8217;t you <a href="http://donttellmichelle.com/">set up your own rules and give it a try</a>? I bet you will never want to go back to (broken) standard Facebook privacy setting.</p>

<p>Ah, and if you don&#8217;t want your wife to know how much high-cholesterol food you eat, then <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2010/03/dont_tell_michelle_obama_says.html">&#8220;Don&#8217;t Tell Michelle&#8221;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You must have heard the question several times on the Rails mailing list and different IRC channels: &#8220;Should I test validates_uniqueness_of&#8221;? The standard answer to that one is &#8220;No, you definitely should not. It&#8217;s Rails framework code, and it&#8217;s already thoroughly tested. If you followed this path, you should also test whether objects are properly persisted in the database.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think, however, that the question is wrong and thus you can not give a correct answer. It is wrong because validates_uniqueness_of is the implementation, not the requirement. If you approach it from this angle, the question turns into whether you should test the specific implementation or whether you should verify that (business) requirements are met.</p>

<p>That, in turn, comes down to tests vs. specs (short for specifications) and this is again an opportunity for specs to shine. If you write specs instead of tests (or, to put it in a more mind-warping way: if your tests are actually specs), then the above question is a no-brainer: it&#8217;s part of the specification that no two users can have the same email address, so you must have a spec for it:</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you stick with calling your tests tests (how orthodox! ;) ) then not only you have to think (which consumes a lot of resources), but you can also come to the wrong conclusion and emit a strong business requirement from your test suite. And then you might not remember to have the implementation for it after modifying the code for whatever reason. And then bad things might happen.</p>

<p>(This thought came to me when coming to work in the subway this morning. I was never quite comfortable with the name &#8220;specs&#8221; but now it&#8217;s starting to make a lot of sense to me. You are encouraged to disagree. Dissent is what makes the world progress.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you reading this probably use TextMate. It is an excellent editor with two caveats. The first is that you can only see one file in the editing window (no screen split), the other is that there is no save hook. This latter gave me headaches since I can&#8217;t stand any trailing whitespace in source code and the easiest solution would have been to run a script to remove those when the file is saved.</p>

<p>Without further ado I&#8217;ll paste my solution below. Obviously this is not a difficult task to accomplish so the goal is to share not to show off. I use Git for SCM and the following solution parses out the files that have been modified and runs the whitespace eraser script for those. If you use something else (why do you?) you should obviously change the first building block:</p>

<p>If you decide to use this, it is more convenient to <a href="http://gist.github.com/raw/305654/568290aa63ee3b0b3748b5041654f94ce45f4e5b/erase_trailing_whitespace.rb">download the raw source</a></p>

<p>Hopefully I did my tiny bit to have less trailing whitespace in OS code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;ve read the <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Progammer - From Journeyman to Master</a> (and if you have not, believe me, you should) you might remember one precious advice: learn a new programming language every year. So when the year draws close to its end (around April, that is) I really start thinking about which language should be the one for me next year.</p>

<p>This reflection is very pleasant; it is such a joy to immerse oneself into a new language, to slowly discover its structure, its subtleties and learn new ways of thinking, of approaching a problem (because that&#8217;s probably the biggest gain of it, even surpassing adding another language to your arsenal) that its prospect is already rewarding in itself.</p>

<p>My choice in 2009 fell on <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a>. I love functional programming, its elegance, its cleanness, its statelessness and after getting my feet wet with <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html">ANSI Common LISP</a> a while ago I felt like Clojure would propel me on my way of becoming an FP guru. Guided by <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/shcloj">a great book</a> I wrote a couple of, admittedly <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/clojure_exercises/blob/master/lzw/compressor.clj">not too difficult</a> <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/clojure_exercises/tree/master/sudoku/game.clj">exercises</a>  (hey, a <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/clojure_exercises/tree/master/sudoku/game.clj">sudoku solver</a> is already something, isn&#8217;t it?) and I would certainly like to continue to do more with it in 2010.</p>

<p>Now, on to 2010.</p>

<p><a href="http://mir.aculo.us">Thomas Fuchs</a> is certainly right when he predicts that <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/2010/01/07/web-developments-next-decade/">Javascript will play an increasingly significant role in web development</a>. I was definitely wrong when I had thought of JS as an undebuggable, structure- and featureless, incoherent language. Of course, you can write Javascript code that is like this but I now think that -at least in the case of Javascript- this tells more about the craftsman than about the language.</p>

<p>Make no mistakes, I can already do Javascript! I can miraculously make a check box appear if you click on a link, or update a database record without reloading the page when you press a button and a ton more such wizardry, really. However, I always felt like there was a whole lot more to Javascript than putting some dumb-looking functions in a file and then include it from my html (no, I don&#8217;t think inlining it makes a difference) and I felt uneasy about my javascript functions just standing there on their own without any apparent belonging to a group or some kind of cohesive force or idea that holds them together.</p>

<p>My recent enthusiasm comes from the fact that I had to browse through some of the source code of <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">scriptaculous</a> and I really liked what I saw. The enthusiasm <a href="http://www.codigoergosum.com/2008/10/09/javascript-method-chain.html">is not totally new</a> but looking at that source code demolished the last shreds of my Javascript skepticism, so to speak. So a year later than <a href="http://www.rubyrailways.com/learn-at-least-one-new-language-every-year/">Peter Szinek</a> I am hopping on the same train: Javascript, here I come! If you have read a good book that enhanced your Javascript foo, please tell me about it in the comments.</p>

<p>And you? Have you already chosen your language for 2010?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As some of you might know, I am running a <a href="http://twitter.com/pragthinklearn">few</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/daily_oblique">twitter</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/wikipedia_tfa">channels</a> that use my brainchild, <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/twuckoo">twuckoo</a>, to periodically send a tweet.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://twitter.com/pragthinklearn">two</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/daily_oblique">of</a> these cases the program takes its next message from a file and takes care not to tweet the same thing twice by keeping track of the messages already sent. This means, however, that the pool of sendable messages are depleted after a while and the script simply does not send any more tweets, the channel becomes dead.</p>

<p>This has happened a couple of times in the past and I only realized it with a few days of delay which is kind of awkward (if you were subscribed to one of these accounts, I apologize). So I decided to have twuckoo send a notification in this case so I can go in and refill its queue. Hence twuckoo version 0.3.5 was born which sends an email to the address set in the configuration file when it failed to send a message.</p>

<p>To install it, add <a href="http://gemcutter.org">gemcutter</a> to the list of gem sources if you haven&#8217;t already:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>install.sh </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>gem <span class="nb">source</span> --add http://gemcutter.org
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And install twuckoo:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>install.sh </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>gem install twuckoo
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You might be thinking that it would be more straightforward to have the program replenish itself so that no intervention from the part of the developer is needed. And you would be right, this could be a task for the next version. I still think it is a good idea to send a notification so the (wo)man in charge knows it happened.</p>

<p>So go ahead, have a look at <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/twuckoo">the README</a>, set up your own twitter channel and don&#8217;t fret about when the queue would run dry. You&#8217;ll be notified.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The title probably tells it all, below is the list of technical books I read in 2009. I am -unfortunately :)- not getting paid for any recommendation that lies herein.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to India</a> <span class="author"><em>by Chad Fowler</em></span></h2>

<p>This one is a real motivation booster. Or it might function like love in the case of separated lovers: if you were motivated in the first place, you&#8217;ll get a kick out of this book and want to do everything it recommends right from the next day. If you were not it might depress you to have to do so many things to stay afloat. Full of useful advices mostly drawn from the author&#8217;s personal experience in India. 5/5!</p>

<p>(There is a second, reworked version under the name: <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a>, you should probably buy that one.)</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/fog0000000249.html">User Interface Design for Programmers</a> <span class="author"><em>by Joel Spolsky</em></span></h2>

<p>I real like Joel Spolsky&#8217;s essays both for the content and for his witty style. I laughed out loud on several remarks in this book, too. The book reaffirms how important good UI is, makes it accessible for programmers by giving guidelines and provides some examples of good (and especially bad) examples. Its style makes the &#8220;dry&#8221; technical stuff fun to read.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/resources.html">The Pomodoro Technique</a> <span class="author"><em>by Francesco Cirillo</em></span></h2>

<p>A time-management and productivity tool, the Pomodoro Technique is the latest craze. The technique can be summarized in a few paragraphs, the details fill about 40 pages which comprise this book. <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/resources/cirillo/ThePomodoroTechnique_v1-3.pdf">The e-book</a> can be downloaded for free. Although I do not follow all the advices described in the book fully (like administering the tasks you have done at the end of each day) I think the technique is a great way to achieve focus especially if you have problems with it. (The PragProgs have also recently published <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/snfocus/pomodoro-technique-illustrated">a book about it</a>)</p>

<h2><a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/shcloj">Programming Clojure</a> <span class="author"><em>by Stuart Halloway</em></span></h2>

<p>Clojure is a functional programming language that runs in the JVM (hence the &#8220;j&#8221;, I guess). This excellent book contains everything you need to know to start (and continue) programming in Clojure from multimethods to infinite sequences, from ways to deal with concurrency to understanding and writing macros. Clojure rocks and so does this book!</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/design1/">The Principles of Beautiful Web Design</a> <span class="author"><em>by Jason Beaird</em></span></h2>

<p>I bought this book to be able to do a fancier design than putting black text on white background and using ugly textboxes with Times Roman fonts. It has certainly lived up to this goal and it has some very practical advices and links to resources (I particularly liked the chapter about color). Just as its title says, it explains principles rather than implementation details, which is what I was looking for. That said, I still feel I need another book (and a decent amount of practice, of course) to beam me to the level I had planned to reach before buying it. Any suggestions?</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/book/9780321146533/Test-Driven-Development">Test-Driven Development By Example</a> <span class="author"><em>by Kent Beck</em></span></h2>

<p>A true classic, I reckon this book is a must-read for anyone aspiring to adhere to TDD or in fact for anyone already doing it at any level of mastery. In the first two chapters two distinct functionalities are developed (the first one, the Money example, in Java, the second, the xUnit example, in Python) by tiny steps using TDD, at each step pondering on the problem at hand and giving an explanation of the chosen solution. The third and final chapter deals with TDD patterns and is an invaluable addition to the first two chapters. Now that I am writing about it I feel like I should reread this book in 2010 (and then probably once every year). Red, green, refactor!</p>

<h2><a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl">Pragmatic Thinking and Learning</a> <span class="author"><em>by Andy Hunt</em></span></h2>

<p>The fact that I have not finished only goes to show its splendidness, I simply don&#8217;t want it to end yet. (I read this in a Paul Graham essay but I can&#8217;t find it right now). Its subtitle, &#8220;Refactor your wetware&#8221;, is telling: it shows you how to make yourself more productive by harnessing the innate capabilities of your brain and debugging its intrinsic &#8220;bugs&#8221;. I guess it is also a very refreshing read because it is about our mind and its workings and not some dry technical stuff. The stories and anecdotes linked to some of the sections makes it easy to recall the message. In fact, I liked this book so much I created a <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/twuckoo/">&#8220;twitter mini-framework&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/pragthinklearn">a twitter channel</a> for the concise version of the advices.</p>

<h2>Life is not just about stubbing, view helpers and achromatic color schemes</h2>

<p>On a Christmas evening, I sat down on a comfy sofa with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Révolutions-J-M-G-Clézio/dp/2070768538">Révolutions by J.M.G. Le Clézio</a> in my hand and was totally immersed in it right from page one. I realized I need occasions like this to repeatedly remind myself how much I miss of life if I only ever read technical books. (Sadly, my list of novels I read last year is a lot shorter than the above one but I heartily recommend you <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128029.A_Thousand_Splendid_Suns">A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini</a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/887407.Poisson_D_or">Poisson d&#8217;or by J.M.G. Le Clézio</a>)</p>

<h2>Any good books you have read?</h2>

<p>I am also making a (so far, only mental) list of books for this year and would like to hear your opinion, too. So have you read any books lately that you would passionately recommend for others?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other day thinking about how <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/i15r">i15r</a> could be improved I realized that there are times when the language of the non-internationalized site is not English (surprise, surprise). Add to this that lots of languages have &#8220;special&#8221; characters, characters that may not be properly found and replaced by the matchers. So I first learned the basics of <a href="http://blog.grayproductions.net/articles/understanding_m17n">how Ruby handles encodings</a> (from <a href="http://blog.grayproductions.net/">James Edward Gray&#8217;s</a> excellent series) and then adjusted a few matchers to catch those special characters, too. (Note: one can&#8217;t underestimate the utility of a spec suite that covers most of the code)</p>

<p>The specs pass but I am pretty certain there are some cases where the matchers might not be up to the task. If you come through such a case, please <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/i15r/issues">submit a bug report</a>. Since there has been a huge improvement in <a href="http://blog.grayproductions.net/articles/ruby_19s_string">string encoding in Ruby 1.9</a> (basically, strings now have an encoding as opposed to in <a href="http://blog.grayproductions.net/articles/bytes_and_characters_in_ruby_18">Ruby 1.8</a>), there might be some cases where strings are properly internationalized using Ruby 1.9 but not with 1.8.</p>

<p>So if you think this is a valuable addition or just have not tried i15r yet, go get it:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I guess it all began with <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">this blog post</a>. I saw that there is another way for composing a blog post than typing it into a textarea with a WYSIWYG interface (which is, by the way, never really WYSIWYG). It also seemed a lot cooler, something a &#8220;real hacker&#8221; would prefer hands down. The decision to switch my blog over to a textarea-free motor has been subconsciously made the time I read that post but the implementation needed a year to be realized. I reckon the final push was to see how easy <a href="http://lackac.hu/2009/11/19/blog-migralas.html">the migration of the blog&#8217;s content</a> is.</p>

<h2>The tools</h2>

<p>I decided to use <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, a static-site generator since it integrates nicely with Github and has all the features I need. Being a static-site generator I needed a client-side solution to handle comments. I chose <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> because that&#8217;s the one I knew and liked but there are <a href="http://intensedebate.com/">alternatives</a>.</p>

<h2>The process</h2>

<h3>Content migration</h3>

<p>I needed continuity and thus migrating the old posts and comments. Fortunately Jekyll includes <a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blog-migrations">migration scripts for several blog motors</a>, among them Wordpress, so that was a piece of cake, everything worked out of the box.</p>

<p>For the comments, I used <a href="http://gist.github.com/261852">a modified version of Lackac&#8217;s script</a>, that he so kindly directed my attention to (thank you, Lackac). Clearly it was more work than migrating the posts but nothing to shy away from. (If you plan to switch from Wordpress to Disqus I believe you&#8217;ll be able to use <a href="http://gist.github.com/261852">the script</a> with a few minor modifications.)</p>

<h3>New design</h3>

<p>For my Wordpress blog, I used a design template that looked ok but was in PHP and was a PITA to modify or to add some styling to. Since I am looking to improve my capabilities as a designer I thought designing my own blog would be a suitable task to get my hands dirty with. I am not concealing the fact that I borrowed ideas from <a href="http://www.briancasel.com/">several</a> <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">blogs</a> I liked but hey, they say it&#8217;s not a shame to copy good ideas so what&#8217;s wrong with that?</p>

<h3>Layout, site feed, etc. with Jekyll</h3>

<p>Have I said I love open source? There is a Jekyll wiki that lists <a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/sites">Jekyll sites</a> along with a link to their sources so seeing how to set up my blog with Jekyll was quite straightforward. I guess this was still the most time-consuming part of all but I did not really have to think of anything, the steps are well-defined. (Here is the <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/balinterdi.github.com">source of my blog</a> if you&#8217;d like to take a glimpse.)</p>

<h3>Buying a Github plan to be able to use a non-github domain</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to host your blog under a custom domain (<a href="http://codigoergosum.com">http://codigoergosum.com</a> instead of <a href="http://balinterdi.github.com">http://balinterdi.github.com</a>) you&#8217;ll need to buy a Github plan. Starting at 7$/month for the Micro plan it&#8217;s not an insurmountable obstacle, in fact it costs less than the Wordpress hosting I am moving away from.</p>

<h2>Changing the name</h2>

<p>Back in the spring of 2008, returning from the <a href="http://www.euruko2008.org/">European Ruby conference</a> (and having finished <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> on the train) my mind was buzzing with new ideas and I could not wait to set myself on a craftsman&#8217;s journey.</p>

<p>I felt I needed a blog immediately. The hard part of course was coming up with a name. Since I felt it was more important to get something going than to idle on finding the perfect one (I guess we can call this agile, can&#8217;t we? :)), I launched <a href="http://bucionrails.com">http://bucionrails.com</a>. During the almost two years that have passed since that day I have grown somewhat uncomfortable with that name so I decided to change it. I hope you like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes">the new one</a> :). (I set up a feed redirection with Feedburner to notify you of the feed URL change after 15 days but you could directly subscribe to the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/codigoergosum">new feed now</a>)</p>

<h2>The end result</h2>

<p>It felt appropriate to start the new year with a new blog and -to my surprise- the switch was a lot easier than I had thought. I hope you, the faithful readers of my blog, welcome the change and ameliorate it with your precious comments.</p>

<p>Now I am blogging like a hacker, too!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just released a new version of the <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/i15r">i15r gem</a> which alleviates the tedious task of internationalizing a Rails site by finding the &#8220;static&#8221; texts and replacing them with I18n message strings.</p>

<p>The good news -and probably the reason I am writing a blog post about it- is that it can now process <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">haml</a> files, too. This must cheer up those who -like me- have come to like haml so much they now use it for their projects. So <a href="http://gemcutter.org/gems/i15r">go get it</a> and let me know how it works for you.</p>

<time datetime="2009-10-28T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 28<span>th</span>, 2009</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>(See <a href="http://bucionrails.com/2009/10/20/rubygems-under-the-hood-introduction/">the introduction</a> to the series.)</p>

<p>When you want to pull in a Ruby library, you require it. The library you require has to be on Ruby&#8217;s load path ($LOAD_PATH) in order to succeed. So let&#8217;s see how Rubygems hooks into this process.</p>

<p>The secret lies in custom_require.rb. You&#8217;ll see a nice comment near the top.</p>

<blockquote>
When you call &#8220;require &#8216;x&#8217;&#8221;, this is what happens:
  * If the file can be loaded from the existing Ruby loadpath, it is.
  * Otherwise, installed gems are searched for a file that matches.
If it&#8217;s found in gem &#8216;y&#8217;, that gem is activated (added to the loadpath).
</blockquote>


<p>In fact, that explanation looks so straightforward to me that I doubt if I can add more words to precise it, so let&#8217;s look at the code together:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='ruby'>module Kernel
  alias gem_original_require require
  (...)
  def require(path) # :doc:
    gem_original_require path
  rescue LoadError =&gt; load_error
    if load_error.message =~ /#{Regexp.escape path}\z/ and
       spec = Gem.searcher.find(path) then
      Gem.activate(spec.name, &quot;= #{spec.version}&quot;)
      gem_original_require path
    else
      raise load_error
    end
  end
(...)
end</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Aliasing a method, redefining it and calling the original version from the redefined method is a very familiar pattern if you have read Rails source code (called method chaining).</p>

<p>So, just as the above description says, if the file can be loaded &#8220;without Rubygems&#8221; it is and Rubygems never comes into the picture. If not, we make sure that the load error comes from the file not found on the load path and then find the gemspec for that file and activate it.</p>

<p>Activating it adds it to the load path, so we can call the original require safe in the knowledge that it will now succeed and we won&#8217;t get another load error this time around (and go into an infinite loop). Clever, heh?</p>

<p>This is one of the cases when the code is so simple for a moment I think I could have written it myself. With its &lt;10 lines of code Rubygems is empowered to load a myriad of useful Ruby libraries. Isn&#8217;t this wonderful?</p>
